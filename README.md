# ACGIM-CWA
An improvement mod for the game "ARMA: Cold War Assault", formerly known as "Operation Flashpoint", by "Bohemia Interactive"

It is a collection of add-ons made by the community that are merged into one collection such that they replace all default units.
I've been working on this since 14th september 2007.
