<B>Jun 10, 1982</B>   Ive been skulking around on Nogova for two weeks now, making a few <A HREF="#Intel">observations</A> and keeping out of sight. There are a couple of other Special Ops guys here, but theyre staying low too.
<br><br><BR><BR> 
HQ contacted me mid-afternoon two days ago while I was preparing in a nearby village. They finally told me my mission objective, to destroy a bridge the enemy is using to transport supplies across the island. I've kept my distance from the target area until now because it's heavily defended. I've got about 20 minutes to get in there and designate the bridge before a convoy passes.

<h2><a name="Intel"></a>My observation</h2>
<p>
<br>
There is an enemy outpost at <A HREF="marker:neveklov">Neveklov</A>.
<br>
<br>
The road from <A HREF="marker:Davle">Davle</A> to the north seems to be full of enemy patrols.

<p><a name="plan"></a>
We need you to guide our AC-130 to the target, a bridge currently occupied by the enemy. It's well guarded and the surrounding areas are full of enemy patrols. You'll have to be careful and move in with extreme caution. If possible, try to do it before 0300 when a large enemy convoy is expected to cross the bridge.
<br><br>
You'll start hidden in the small village of <A HREF="marker:Start">Skalice</A>.

<p><a name = "OBJ_1"></a>Infiltrate the area and designate the target, the <a href="marker:zakladna">bridge</a> at Fi67.

<p><a name = "OBJ_2"></a>Destroy the bridge at least partially such that enemy convoys can't cross it.

<p><a name = "OBJ_3"></a>Return to the village <a href="marker:Start">Skalice</a> and await further instructions.

<p>
The target was destroyed and the enemy convoy was prevented from crossing the inlet. Great job commander.

The target was destroyed but the enemy convoy had already crossed. This is unfortunate but the mission can still be called a success. Well done commander.
</p>

The bridge is still there. What were you <I>doing</I> out there commander?

Youve been injured too badly to complete your mission. Tough break, commander.

You seem to have no idea what youre doing, Gastovski  youre hopelessly lost in enemy territory.
